# PAGASAClimateNormals-pdf2txt2csv

This repository consists of a project with programs written in Python creating CSV files containing the climatological normals of stations in the Philippines every month.
The outputted CSV files from this project would be utilized to create a data visualization of the climatological normals in the Philippines.

## The project follows this process:
1. Read the PDF files of climatological normals from DOST-PAGASA, accessible through this link: https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/climate-data
2. Create TXT file version of each PDF file, containing climatological normals for each station.
3. Run through this TXT file to obtain corresponding values to be stored in the CSV file.


## The following are the columns for the said CSV file. Each CSV file contains climatological normals of the stations for a specific month.
1. Station
2. Month
3. Latitude (Decimal Degrees format)
4. Elevation (m)
5. Period
6. Rainfall (mm)
7. Number of Rainy Days
8. Maximum Temperature (°C)
9. Minimum Temperature (°C)
10. Mean Temperature (°C)
11. Dry Bulb Temperature (°C)
12. Wet Bulb Temperature (°C)
13. Dew Point (°C)
14. Vapor Pressure (mbs)
15. Relative Humidity (%)
16. Mean Sea Level Pressure (mbs)
17. Wind Direction (16pt)
18. Wind Speed (mps)
19. Cloud Amount (okta)
20. Number of Days with Thunderstorm
21. Number of Days with Lightning

For more information regarding the description of each climate parameter, kindly refer to any of the PDF file of climatological normals from DOST-PAGASA.

For any inappropriate or faulty data stored in the CSV files, or any other concerns, you could send me an email at siulnaj0117@gmail.com.
